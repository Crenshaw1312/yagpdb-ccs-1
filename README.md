# YAGPDB-CCs
The custom commands posted here are for free use, however if you do with to support me you can rep me in the [YAGPDB Support Server](https://discord.com/invite/4udtcA5) or gift Nitro *if you're that generous*. My tag is **@Devonte#0745** :)
I am currently taking requests for CCs to add to this repository!
