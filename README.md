# YAGPDB-CCs
The custom commands posted here are for free use, however if you do with to support me you can rep me in the [YAGPDB Support Server](https://discord.com/invite/4udtcA5).
I am currently taking any custom command requests in return for Nitro, if you're interested you can contact me also in the support server **@ Devonte#0745**.

__Available custom commands:__

Custom Mute CC v1
* A selective channel Mute custom commmand that works just like it sounds. It can be edited to also send messages in Mod-Log channels when used.

*More custom commands will be added in future. If you wish to contribute or PR for any of these custom commands feel free to do so.*
