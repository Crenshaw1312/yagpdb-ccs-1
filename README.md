# YAGPDB-CCs
The custom commands posted here are for free use, however if you do with to support me you can rep me in the [YAGPDB Support Server](https://discord.com/invite/4udtcA5) or gift Nitro *if you're that generous*. My tag is **@Devonte#0745** (ID 622146791659405313) ðŸ˜‰
I am currently taking requests for CCs to add to this repository!

## Available custom commands:

<details>
  <summary>Custom Mute CC</summary>
  <br>
  A selective channel mute custom command that works just like it sounds. It can be edited to also send messages in Mod-Log channels when used.
  *Note:* this CC is no longer supported as there are more efficient versions of this code. Eventually, when there are more CCs added to this repository, this custom command will be removed.

<details>
  <summary>JSONify CC v4.11</summary>
  <br>
  Converts and outputs JSON format of messages, as well as IDs, message types, message snowflake, (etc). See README.md for more info.
  </br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Report CCs (grouped v2)</summary>
  <br>
  A fully functioning reports system with reaction interactions, database storage, and admin commands. You can find out more info in the README.md
  </br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Ghost-Ping Detection (v1 & v2)</summary>
  <br>
  An accurate ghost-ping detection custom command with optional double checks, mention checks (for edited messages) and more. Ghost-Ping CCs are purposefully made to be easily edited / interchangeable, see README.md fore more info.
